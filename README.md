- **Dynamic Visualization Generation**: Create charts and graphs on demand
- **AI-Assisted Code Execution**: Generate and run Python code for data analysis
- **Multiple Dataset Support**: Use example datasets or upload your own
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit for a seamless user experience

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-analytics-assistant.git
cd data-analytics-assistant
```

2. Install required packages:
